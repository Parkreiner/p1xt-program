## The Box Model

## Padding

## Margins

## Borders

## Things that apply to all three

### `none` vs `0` for padding, margins, and border thickness

When you're giving an element padding, margins, or border thickness, the single values `0` and `none` do the exact same
thing. The only real difference is that `0` is a few characters shorter, which, granted, can increase load times
(however slightly), especially if you're removing padding, margins, or borders on a frequent basis.
