# CSS Values

## List of main values

### `0`

### `px`

### `%`

### `em`

### `rem`

### `pt`

### `vw`

### `vh`

### `vmin`

### `vmax`

### `ex`

The `ex` unit is equal to the height of an element's lowercase x. This isn't quite as useful as `em` and `rem` for
typography, but it does have its uses. When using subscripts and superscripts, this unit can help you nudge an element
up or down (a `1ex` works a lot of times for either direction).

Curiously, this unit has been around since the very beginning of CSS, yet it barely gets used.

### `ch`

This measurement is the width of the character `0` within an element with a given set of text settings. Since characters
within a mono-spaced font will always be equal in length, this property can help you ensure that an element fits an
exact number of characters. However, it's supposed to be used for braille support.

This unit of measurement is a little more new, though.
