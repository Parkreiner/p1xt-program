# Description
Code I make while working through [Git user P1xt's Job-Ready guide (JavaScript Edition 2.0)](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-2.0.md). Large projects will likely get dedicated repositories.

# Current Progress
As of June 10, 2018, I have completed all of Harvard's CS50 except its final project, I'm working through *You Don't Know JS*, and I'm starting to learn HTML and SASS. I'll likely wait until I know more about web development before starting the final project.
