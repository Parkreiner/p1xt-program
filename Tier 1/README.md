# p1xt Tier 1

I modified the curriculum for this tier somewhat, so now I'm doing things in this order:

1. p1xt course until I need to make my first site from a mockup
2. Learn BEM
3. Continue with p1xt until I need to create my second site from a mockup
4. Go through Microsoft's Advanced CSS course on EdX (to be stored in Tier 1.5 folder)
5. Complete Wes Bos' Intro to React course (to be stored in different repository entirely)
6. Complete the remainder of p1xt tier 1
