# Lesson 2: Getting to know HTML

## Semantics Overview
Semantics just refers to giving content meaning â€“ labeling it, so that you know what role each element plays inside
the webpage. Giving your web pages good semantics is in your best interests, because it not only helps you trend
better in Google search results, but it helps users accessing your page through screen readers.

## Identifying divisions and spans
However, HTML does have two elements that have *zero* semantic meaning. They exist only to make styling content through
selectors easier.
