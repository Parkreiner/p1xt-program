## `border-collapse` question

Why do you need to use `border-collapse: separate` to ensure that, when you give borders to the `<td>` elements in a
table's body but don't do the same to the head's `<th>` elements, the head and body have the same width?

[Here's the CodePen I'm looking at.](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/EpYJBK)

I see that by changing the `border-collapse` property to `collapse`, the head and body become different widths. But I
guess my problem is that I don't understand the property enough, because I don't get what's going on with it. Why is it
behaving like that?
