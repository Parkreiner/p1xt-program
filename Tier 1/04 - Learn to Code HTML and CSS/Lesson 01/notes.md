# Lesson 1: Building Your First Webpage
## What are HTML and CSS?
HTML and CSS should remain as separate as possible. HTML defines the semantic structure of a document, while CSS defines its styling. It's possible to have inline CSS, but that's probably super-jank.

## Understanding Common HTML Terms
The three main terms I need to familiarize myself with are elements, tags, and attributes.

### Elements
These are the parts that comprise the HTML document â€“ they're the building blocks. Most elements are made of three parts:
1. The opening tag
2. The content
3. The closing tag

Though there exist self-closing tags, which basically roll (2) and (3) into the opening tag.

### Tags
This is what encloses HTML elements to give them semantic meaning. All of them are letters enclosed in angle brackets, e.g. <p>, `<a>`, etc.

### Attributes
