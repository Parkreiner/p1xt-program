# Chapter 03 â€“ Into YDKJS

This is a very short chapter that focuses on giving an overview on the subjects that the other books cover. So, here's
just a quick list of takeaways from it:

1. Closures are the most important concept to understand in JS. If you can understand them, learning everything else will prove much easier.
2. Again, JS objects are **nothing** like those in other languages. But that won't stop developers from contorting them to match a form they're familiar with.
3. Coercion isn't evil. You just need to bother to understand it.
